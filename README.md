# Basketball Dictionaries
This was a brief exercise involving data-structures completed for Coding Dojo's Python Fullstack
### Objectives:
* Update a class constructor to accept a single dictionary of data, rather than many arguments.
* Use dictionary data to create an object instance
* Populate a list of object instances from a list of dictionaries
* Write a class method that populates a list of object isntances from a list of dictionaries
### Additional functionality for extra practice:
* Add an `@classmethod` called `get_team(cls, team_list)` that, given a list of dictionaries populates and returns a new list of Player objects. Be sure to test your method!
